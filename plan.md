## Plan to Fix Port 8000 Conflict and Start Next.js Dev Server

### Overview
The task is to resolve the "EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8000" error when starting the Next.js development server. This occurs because another process is already using port 8000. The solution is to kill the process on that port and then start the server.

### Requirements
- No API keys or external credentials required.
- System-level commands to manage processes.

### Step-by-Step Plan

#### 1. **Kill the Process Using Port 8000**
- Use the `fuser` command to identify and kill the process occupying port 8000.
- Command: `fuser -k 8000/tcp`
- This will terminate the process using the port without affecting other Node.js processes.

#### 2. **Start the Next.js Development Server**
- After killing the conflicting process, run the development server.
- Command: `PORT=8000 npm run dev` (which runs `next dev --turbopack`)
- The server should start successfully on port 8000.

### Expected Outcome
- The port conflict is resolved.
- The Next.js dev server runs on http://localhost:8000 with Turbopack enabled.

### Error Handling
- If `fuser` is not available, alternative methods may be needed (e.g., `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9`).
- Verify the server starts by checking for the success message in the terminal output.

### Summary
- Kill the process on port 8000 using `fuser -k 8000/tcp`.
- Start the Next.js dev server with `PORT=8000 npm run dev`.
- Ensure the server runs without errors.
